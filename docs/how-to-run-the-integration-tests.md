# How to run the integration tests

Integration tests run checks against a live JIRA server that has been pre-populated with test data. JIRA can be run using the [official Atlassian Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/jira-software) 
which makes it easy to run the tests on both Jira v7 and v8.

By default the tests are run against Jira 8.5.2

## Prerequisites

The only dependency to run the integration tests are a tiny bit of knowledge of the command line, and Docker:

- Install Docker for Linux ([Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/),
  [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/), and
  [others](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)...)
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

## Prepare the Jira instance

### Automated Setup

Automated setup uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the Chrome browser to run through the JIRA setup wizard. It requires the machine to have Chrome installed.

1. Set environment variable `JIRA_VERSION`

```cmd
// WINDOWS
SET JIRA_VERSION=8.5.2
```

2. Run docker container
```cmd
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Setup Jira test data

```cmd
dotnet Atlassian.Jira.Test.Integration.Setup/bin/netcoreapp3.1/JiraSetup.dll 8.5.2
```

After running the commands wait until the Chrome window is closed. If successful, the console should show `--- Finished setting up Jira ---`.


### Manual Setup (Windows)

Useful if anything fails with the automated setup above.

- Launch the docker container.
```cmd
SET JIRA_VERSION=8.5.2
docker-compose up -d
```
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080.
- Once the setup wizard loads click on “I’ll set it up myself” and “Next”.
- On the next screen Keep “Built in” selected and click on “Next” (wait until database is setup).
- On the next screen click on the “import your data” link at the top.
- Enter “TestData_8.5.2.zip” in the “File Name” field and click on “Import” (wait until the test data is imported).

### Setup a different version of Jira
Each Jira version requires a different test data file, look in the `Atlassian.Jira.Test.Integration.Setup/import/` folder for the versions that are available. For example, if there is a file `Atlassian.Jira.Test.Integration.Setup/import/TestData_8.5.0.zip` then you can setup version `8.5.0` using the same commands.

## Run the integration tests

Once the image is up and running you can run the integration tests within your IDE.

But you might prefer the command line:
```cmd
$ dotnet test Atlassian.Jira.Test.Integration/
```

## Clean the container

To clean the Docker containers launched for the integration tests:
```cmd
$ docker-compose down -v
```
